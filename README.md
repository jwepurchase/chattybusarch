# Insurance Business Architecture

## Overview
This branch (`insurance-example`) contains a structured representation of the **Business Architecture** for the **Property & Casualty Insurance** domain. The architecture is represented using JSON files, which define business capabilities, value streams, stakeholders, and related components.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a modular approach where each **Level 1 capability** has its own JSON file, and related **Level 2 and Level 3 capabilities** are contained within the same file.

```
insurance-example/
├── capabilities/               # Business capabilities
│   ├── CAP-001.json            # Policy Administration
│   ├── CAP-002.json            # Underwriting
│   ├── CAP-003.json            # Claims Management
│   ├── CAP-004.json            # Reinsurance Management
│   ├── ...                     # Additional capabilities
├── schema.json                 # JSON Schema for validation (if applicable)
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Capabilities
The `capabilities/` directory contains JSON files representing business capabilities relevant to the **Property & Casualty Insurance** industry. Each file follows the structure:

```json
{
  "id": "CAP-001",
  "name": "Policy Administration",
  "description": "Manages the lifecycle of insurance policies, including issuance, endorsement, renewal, and cancellation.",
  "sub_capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "CAP-001-01",
      "name": "Policy Issuance",
      "description": "Handles policy creation and document generation."
    },
    {
      "id": "CAP-001-02",
      "name": "Policy Renewal",
      "description": "Manages automatic and manual policy renewals."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Guidelines for Contributions
If you wish to contribute or modify this structure, follow these steps:

2. **Add or update JSON files** following the established structure.
3. **Validate JSON files** against `schema.json` (if applicable).
4. **Submit a pull request** for review.

## Future Enhancements
